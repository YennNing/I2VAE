## 🔍 Motivation

Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) faces severe challenges in modeling cold-start and long-tailed users due to limited overlapping behaviors and sparse interactions. To address these challenges, **i²VAE** introduces:

- Mutual information-based variational regularizers to learn **disentangled cross-domain interests**.
- A **pseudo-sequence generator (PSG)** that augments user behavior with retrieved candidate items.
- A **denoising regularizer** to filter out noisy pseudo interactions while retaining useful signals.

## 📂 Dataset

The `dataset/` folder includes three preprocessed datasets used in the paper. The preprocessing follows [AMID (WWW 2024)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589334.3645351), and can be found in:

```bash
dataset/process/process_data.ipynb
```

The included datasets already contain pseudo-sequences generated using our PSG. If you wish to generate your own pseudo-sequences:

1. Clone and train the official [LightGCN](https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch.git) repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch.git
   cd LightGCN-PyTorch
   ```
2. Train on your domain data.
3. Run the callback script to generate pseudo-sequences:
   ```bash
   python callback.py
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Code

To train i²VAE with our settings:

```bash
sh train_ours.sh
```

Model checkpoints and logs will be saved to the corresponding output directories.

After training, you can process and evaluate the saved results using:

```bash
dataset/process/process_checkpoint.ipynb
```
